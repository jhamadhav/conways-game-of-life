John conway's game of life

# What does it mean?

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. <br>
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing
how it evolves.

# Rules:

-  Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
-  Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
-  Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
-  Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
